% % The trapezoidal method integrates linear functions exactly, and this property
% % was used in the test function test_trapezoidal_linear in the file test_
% % trapezoidal.m. Change the function used in Sect. 3.4.2 to f.x/ D 6108x4106
% % and rerun the test. What happens? How must you change the test to make it useful?
% % How does the convergence rate test behave? Any need for adjustment?
